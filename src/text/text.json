    "i am a first-generation taiwanese-american. i was born with an s-shaped spine and had to get surgery for it when i was 2 years old (thank you dr. gamble). i don't remember any of it but my mom said the hospital stocked up on popsicles just for me :)",
    "my hometown is in the cloudy sf bay area, but my heart is in the sunny beaches of southern california.",
    "i have a degree in sociology and minor in philosophy, a certification in data analytics, and professional experience in full stack development for small teams.",
    "my love of writing poetry transfers into my love of writing simple, elegant code.",
    "i am a fast learner and able to adapt within any industry. i love collaborating with my team members because i believe we are better together.",
    "when i‚Äôm not coding, i‚Äôm either hanging out with my cats, going on adventures with my husband, writing poetry, spilling tea with my best friend, or sipping tea while reading a book (yes, the paper kind).",
    "p.s. i am working on my first collection of poetry üçë"
